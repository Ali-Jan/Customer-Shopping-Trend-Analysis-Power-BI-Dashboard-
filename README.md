# Customer Shopping Trend Analysis

I recently developed a dashboard for a business to **understand customer shopping behavior and purchasing trends** across **demographics, categories, seasons, and regions**. Upon analyzing the data, several patterns emerged that highlight both strengths and opportunities for growth.

**Customer purchases** totaled **$233,081**, with an **average sale** value of **$60** and an **average review rating** of **3.75**, pointing to moderately satisfied customers. The **most revenue** came from **Clothing ($104K)**, followed by Accessories ($74K), while categories like Outerwear and Footwear contributed significantly less.

The **45–59 age group stands out as the most valuable segment**, with the highest number of total and high-value purchases. Not far behind are the 30–44 and 60+ age groups, showing potential for targeted expansion. Younger customers (18–29) made fewer high-value purchases, indicating a price sensitivity or lesser engagement with higher-ticket items.

Gender-based analysis revealed that **male customers purchase more frequently than females** across all buying intervals, from weekly to annually. This consistency may reflect either stronger product-market fit for male shoppers or more habitual purchasing patterns.

Seasonal trends show a relatively stable revenue distribution across Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, with a **slight peak in Fall ($60K)**. This stability is a positive indicator for supply chain planning, allowing for balanced inventory flow year-round.

When it comes to fulfillment, shipping data from **top-performing cities (Montana, California, Idaho, Illinois, Nevada)** suggests a strong preference for Free Shipping and Store Pickup, especially in Illinois and Montana. Cities like Nevada and California lean more toward Next Day Air and 2-Day Shipping, reflecting possible urban demand for convenience or faster delivery expectations.

## Summary:

Underlying these insights are a few **important drivers**. The **45–59 segment** likely has higher disposable income and stronger brand affinity, explaining their higher purchase volume and value. **Males purchasing more frequently** may be linked to the types of products offered or more streamlined buying behaviors. The **popularity of Clothing and Accessories** stems from their broad appeal and frequent utility. In contrast, Outerwear and Footwear may be seen as seasonal or infrequent purchases. Lastly, the **average review rating of 3.75** hints at potential friction in the customer experience—possibly around product quality, delivery speed, or service.

## To capitalize on these findings, the **business should**:

**Double down on marketing** to the 45–59 age segment, using loyalty programs or exclusive deals to retain them.

**Introduce incentives** for younger demographics, such as bundle offers or milestone-based discounts, to drive high-value purchases.

**Expand offerings** in high-performing categories like Clothing, with curated collections or limited drops to spark interest.

**Enhance the shipping strategy** by promoting Free Shipping in regions that favor it and offering flexible upgrades in fast-delivery regions.

**Investigate the root of customer dissatisfaction** to lift the review score above 4.0—this may involve improvements in logistics, product descriptions, or post-purchase support.

**Leverage Fall and Spring for major campaigns**, since these seasons already perform well and could yield higher ROI with focused promotions.

These insights not only reveal who the most valuable customers are and what they prefer, but also offer **clear direction for boosting satisfaction, retention, and revenue across multiple dimensions.**
